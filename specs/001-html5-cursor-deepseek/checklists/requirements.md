## Validation Results Summary

**Total Checks**: 89  
**Passed**: 89  
**Failed**: 0  
**Warnings**: 1 (Edge case clarification needed - acceptable)

**Overall Status**: ✅ **SPECIFICATION APPROVED**

This specification is ready for implementation planning and development.

## Recommendations

1. **Before Implementation**: Clarify the multilingual support edge case (currently flagged as NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
2. **For MVP**: Focus on Phase 1 (P1 user stories) for fastest time-to-value
3. **Testing Strategy**: Create test cases directly from the 33 acceptance scenarios
4. **Documentation**: Use the 12 Key Entities as foundation for API and database schema design

### Configuration Notes

- All API keys should be stored in `.env` file (not committed to git)
- Add `.env` to `.gitignore` immediately
- For production deployment on Netlify, configure these as environment variables in the Netlify dashboard
- Implement automatic fallback logic: if DeepSeek fails, try GLM, then Moonshot, etc.
- Consider implementing API key rotation for security
