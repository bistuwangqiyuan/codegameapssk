# Tasks: GameCode Lab - Ê∏∏ÊàèÂåñ HTML5 ÁºñÁ®ãÊïôËÇ≤Âπ≥Âè∞

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-html5-cursor-deepseek/`  
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ‚úÖ, spec.md ‚úÖ, research.md ‚úÖ  
**Branch**: `001-html5-cursor-deepseek`

**Tests**: Tests are not explicitly requested in the specification, so test tasks are not included in this implementation plan.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story. The MVP consists of User Stories 1, 2, and 4 (all P1 priorities).

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1, US2, US3, etc.)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

**Web application structure** (Astro full-stack):

- Frontend: `src/pages/`, `src/components/`, `src/layouts/`
- API Routes: `src/pages/api/`
- Libraries: `src/lib/`
- State: `src/stores/`
- Edge Functions: `supabase/functions/`
- Tests: `tests/`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-9)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - After Foundation: User Stories 1, 2, 4 can proceed in parallel (all P1 - MVP)
  - After MVP: User Stories 3, 7 can proceed in parallel (P2)
  - After P2: User Stories 5, 6 can proceed in parallel (P3)
- **Polish (Phase 10)**: Depends on desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Completely independent
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Uses US1 (trial system) but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Enhances US1/US2 but independently testable
- **User Story 4 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Completely independent
- **User Story 5 (P3)**: Can start after US2 completion (requires lessons) - Uses US2/US4 but independently testable
- **User Story 6 (P3)**: Can start after US4 completion (requires projects) - Uses US4 but independently testable
- **User Story 7 (P2)**: Can start after US2 completion (requires lessons) - Uses US2 but independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Entity types before queries/services
- Queries/services before API endpoints
- API endpoints before UI components
- Core implementation before enhancements
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (T003-T014)
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel within phase (T020-T034)
- **After Foundational completes, MVP stories (US1, US2, US4) can all start in parallel**
- Entity type definitions within a story can run in parallel (T035-T037, T054-T055, etc.)
- Independent components marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: MVP (User Stories 1, 2, 4)

Once Foundational phase completes, launch all three MVP stories simultaneously:

```bash
# Team Member A: User Story 1 (Guest Trial)
Tasks T035-T053

# Team Member B: User Story 2 (Learning Path + AI)
Tasks T054-T080

# Team Member C: User Story 4 (Code Sandbox)
Tasks T081-T101
```

Within each story, tasks marked [P] can also run in parallel:

```bash
# Example: User Story 1 entity types (all in src/types/entities.ts, but different sections)
Task T035: User entity types
Task T036: GuestTrial entity types
Task T037: XP and Level entity types
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1, 2, 4 Only)

1. **Complete Phase 1: Setup** (T001-T014) - ~2-3 days
2. **Complete Phase 2: Foundational** (T015-T034) - ~1 week (CRITICAL - blocks everything)
3. **Complete Phase 3: User Story 1** (T035-T053) - ~1 week
4. **Complete Phase 4: User Story 2** (T054-T080) - ~2 weeks
5. **Complete Phase 5: User Story 4** (T081-T101) - ~1 week
6. **MVP VALIDATION**: Test all three stories independently
7. **Partial Polish** (T171-T196, select critical items) - ~3-5 days
8. **Deploy MVP to production** - Launch!

**Total MVP Timeline**: ~6-7 weeks

### Incremental Delivery

1. Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready (~2 weeks)
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Guest trial working!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Learning path + AI working!)
4. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Code sandbox working!) **= MVP LAUNCH**
5. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Gamification complete!)
6. Add User Story 7 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Teacher tools ready!)
7. Add User Story 6 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Community active!)
8. Add User Story 5 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Advanced challenges live!)
9. Each increment adds value without breaking previous features

### Parallel Team Strategy

With 3 developers after Foundational phase:

- **Developer A**: User Story 1 (Guest Trial) - 1 week
- **Developer B**: User Story 2 (Learning Path) - 2 weeks
- **Developer C**: User Story 4 (Code Sandbox) - 1 week

Developer A and C can then assist with User Story 2 or move to P2 stories.

With 5+ developers after Foundational phase:

- All P1 stories in parallel (US1, US2, US4) - ~2 weeks
- Then P2 stories in parallel (US3, US7) - ~1-2 weeks
- Then P3 stories in parallel (US5, US6) - ~1-2 weeks

**Full Feature Set Timeline**: ~10-14 weeks total

## Task Summary

**Total Tasks**: 196
**MVP Tasks**: T001-T101 (101 tasks)
**Enhancement Tasks**: T102-T170 (69 tasks)
**Polish Tasks**: T171-T196 (26 tasks)

**Tasks by User Story**:

- Setup: 14 tasks
- Foundational: 20 tasks
- User Story 1 (P1): 19 tasks
- User Story 2 (P1): 27 tasks
- User Story 3 (P2): 19 tasks
- User Story 4 (P1): 21 tasks
- User Story 5 (P3): 14 tasks
- User Story 6 (P3): 17 tasks
- User Story 7 (P2): 19 tasks
- Polish: 26 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities**: 87 tasks marked [P] can run in parallel within their phase
**MVP Focus**: Tasks T001-T101 deliver a complete, shippable product

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files or independent sections, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story is independently completable and testable
- Tests are not included as they were not explicitly requested in specification
- MVP consists of User Stories 1, 2, and 4 (all P1 priorities)
- Commit after each task or logical group for better traceability
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- **RECOMMENDATION**: Implement MVP (Phases 1-5) first, validate with users, then proceed with P2/P3 features based on feedback

---

**Ready to start**: Tasks are now executable. Begin with T001 and proceed sequentially through Setup, then Foundational, then MVP user stories.
